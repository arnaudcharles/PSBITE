# PSBITE

**PSBITE** stand for "**P**owerShell **B**uffer **I**nsert **T**ext **E**ditor". It's a VIM-like text editor that supports both local and remote file editing.
It provides a familiar VIM interface with NORMAL and INSERT modes, character operations, and real-time remote synchronization.

Another function, **Edit-RemoteFile** is providing another way to remotly **open/editing** file with **VSCode** (or notepad) using **WinRM**.

## How it started

Since I was using core server, as soon as you need to manipulate file, logs or create file without GUI it was honestly a nightmare for me. I was not able to find something like nano built-in or even depending on VSCode. Because I'm working in a high secure area, we cannot afford to install cosmetic or non approved software like Vim on each servers. This is where the creation of this module started, because custom and selfmade PowerShell module are already running why not creating mine that can benefit my daily work and help the community ?

It was like a challenge after attemping **PSConf**, I wanted to make something that was able to make me proud and ready to myself go on stage next time.

Then Edit-RemoteFile came alive in parallel for the same reasons, mainly for internal usage but finally integrated to PSBite because it's working not the same way and can also benefit to other users.

## Prerequisites

- Require PowerShell 7

## Installation

To install the module from the PowerShell Gallery, you can use the following command:

```

## Example of Usage

Here is a list of example that are typical use cases for the module.

### Edit with bidirectional synchronization (remote changes are pulled to local)

```powershell
Edit-RemoteFile -ComputerName "server01" -RemotePath "C:\Scripts\test.ps1" -Dual
```

Start-PSBite -FilePath "C:\scripts\remote.ps1" -ComputerName "server01"
```

## How Edit-RemoteFile differ from Start-PSBite ?

They don't use the same method to work.
PSBite is a VI like that capture the key touched to do action where Edit-RemoteFile monitor the file to take action.
